# X-Puzzle
[Project repo](https://github.com/ribal-aladeeb/state-space-search)

## Project
The aim of the project is to implement and analyze various search algorithms
that will solve the X-Puzzle. In this project, we start off by looking at 2x4
puzzle boards. Our job is to solve the boards using Uniform Cost, Greedy Best
First & A* algorithms. Finally, we'll look into scalability options for our
solution to handle bigger boards.
