The following report is written in partial fulfilment of the requirements of COMP472.For any questions or concerns, please contact Leila Kosseim from Concordia Universityâ€™s faculty.


## Project
The aim of the project is to implement and analyze various search algorithms that will solve the X-Puzzle. In this project, we start off by looking at 2x4 puzzle boards. Our job is to solve the boards using Uniform Cost, Greedy Best First & A* algorithms. Finally, we'll look into scalability options for our solution to handle bigger boards.

## Requirements
### Using Conda
Make sure you have Conda installed on your machine
```
conda env create --name project1 --file=environment.yml
conda activate project1
```

### Otherwise


### Credits
>>>>>>> Set up dev environment
