## Project
The aim of the project is to implement and analyze various search algorithms that will solve the X-Puzzle. In this project, we start off by looking at 2x4 puzzle boards. Our job is to solve the boards using Uniform Cost, Greedy Best First & A* algorithms. Finally, we'll look into scalability options for our solution to handle bigger boards.

## Requirements
